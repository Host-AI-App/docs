## Overview

Conduit tracks key performance metrics to help you understand how your team and AI are handling customer conversations. This guide explains how these metrics are calculated.

## Response Time

Response time measures the duration between when a customer message arrives and when a reply is sent. This metric helps you understand how quickly your team is responding to customers.

### How It's Calculated

- **Attribution:** Response time is attributed to whoever sends the reply, not who the conversation is assigned to
- **Median calculation:** The dashboard shows the median response time across all replies in the selected time period
- **Exclusions:** Response times over 48 hours are excluded from the calculation to prevent outliers from skewing results

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Who gets the response time? |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Staff A replies to Staff B's conversation | Staff A's response time is counted |
| Multiple people reply to an unassigned conversation | Each person gets their own response time recorded for their reply |

### Things to Keep in Mind

- **Quick responders:** Someone who frequently jumps in to quickly handle others' conversations will naturally have a lower median response time
- **Complex conversations:** Team members who handle more complex conversations requiring research or investigation may have a higher median response time

Response time reflects who actually responds, giving you accurate data about each team member's responsiveness.

## Automation Rate

Automation rate measures the percentage of incoming messages that are fully handled by AI without requiring human intervention.

### How It's Calculated

The automation rate is calculated as:

**Messages handled by AI / Total incoming messages**

A message is considered "handled by AI" when the AI successfully responds to the customer without escalating to a human team member. Messages that result in escalations (where AI needs human help) are not counted as automated.

### What Counts as an Escalation

The AI escalates a conversation when:
- A topic is marked as urgent
- The AI needs confirmation or authorization to complete an action
- There isn't enough information to provide an adequate response
- The message contains attachments the AI can't process

### Improving Your Automation Rate

To increase your automation rate:
- Add more knowledge to your AI agent about common questions
- Create procedures for repetitive tasks
- Review escalation patterns to identify gaps in AI training

For more details on escalation types and how to address them, see the [AI Automation Dashboard](/dashboard/ai-automation-dashboard).
