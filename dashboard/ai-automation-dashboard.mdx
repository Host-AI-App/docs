# AI Automation Dashboard

Spot patterns, fix gaps, and boost automation with Insights

## Overview

The Insights page provides high-level visibility into how frequently the AI fulfills requests versus requiring human escalation. Users can leverage this data to identify optimization opportunities for the AI system. Key metrics include automation rate, frequent escalation types, and escalation topics.

## AI Automation Rate

This metric displays the percentage of messages automatically handled by AI, compared against the previous period. Users can customize both the displayed data range and comparison period via the Overview tab.

## Escalations

Escalations represent situations where the AI cannot respond independently. Users can identify which escalation types occur most frequently and review specific conversation examples by clicking rows.

### Four Escalation Types

1. **Urgent tagged:** Topics marked urgent prevent AI action. Tags can be managed under Settings > Inboxes > Conversation Tags.

2. **AI needs your help:** AI requires human confirmation or authorization to complete an action.

3. **AI missing info:** Insufficient information prevents the AI from providing an adequate response.

4. **Message has attachments:** System supports photo and file attachments only; video attachments cannot be processed.

## Escalations By Message Topic

This visualization reveals which topics generate the most escalations and their associated types. Clicking each bar displays example conversations demonstrating why escalation occurred.
