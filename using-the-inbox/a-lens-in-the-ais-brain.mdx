Conduit provides explainability for every AI-generated message. You can observe the agent's reasoning process, source materials, and next steps without leaving the conversation thread.

## Message Types

Three message types appear in the system:

1. **Sent message** - The AI had high confidence and sent the reply automatically (only on autopilot)

2. **Proposed reply (Co-Pilot)** - The AI drafted a response for your approval

3. **Urgent message** - Escalated based on predefined conversation tags

## Inspecting AI Thinking

### AI Reflection

Press `i` to view how the AI analyzed conversation context and formulated its response plan.

### Sources

Expand to see referenced documents, knowledge base entries, and data points. You can edit sources directly from this view.

## Acting from the Inbox

### Teach (Command + K)

Create or edit Knowledge entries and establish or modify Guardrails (policies/rules). Updates immediately improve future replies.

### Draft (Command + J)

Generate draft replies in the composer for both proposed responses and escalations where a starting point helps.

## Testing the AI

After taking action (teaching or editing sources), verify learning through:

- **Regenerate the message** - For unsent Proposed replies or AI Missing Info messages
- **Recreate in Sandbox** - For sent messages or exact scenario simulation

## Calls

A centralized view displays inbound and outbound calls handled by team members or AI, with full transcripts and AI-generated conversation summaries available per call.
