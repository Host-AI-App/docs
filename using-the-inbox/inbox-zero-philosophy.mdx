## Workflow Features

### Mark Done (E key shortcut)

Completed conversations move to the Done tab for searchability. If contacts respond, conversations automatically return to Todo status.

### Follow-Up/Snooze (Z key shortcut)

Users can set reminders for later action. This feature suits scenarios requiring investigation time - maintenance issues, scheduling, payment confirmations. Conversations transfer from the Follow-Up tab back to Todo when the timer expires.

### Notes & Mentions

Team members add notes via the conversation panel's "Add a note" option. Typing `@` followed by a name mentions specific team members, triggering notifications. The Mentions sidebar provides complete mention history.

### Filters

Organize inboxes by listings, conversation tags, and escalation status.

### Custom Views

Saved filter configurations shareable across team accounts.
