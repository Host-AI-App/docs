Everything in Conduit happens in your team's workspace. A new workspace is automatically created for your team at sign up, but you have the ability to create multiple workspaces.

## Invite Your Team Members

Navigate to **Settings > Members** in your workspace. Admins can invite new members, manage their roles, and remove members as needed.

## Using the Inbox

### Get to Inbox Zero

A clean inbox is the foundation of a strong support team. Conversations flow through **Todo**, **Follow-Up**, and **Done**, helping you prioritize and clean up your inbox daily.

### Work Together to Resolve Issues

- Collaborate directly within guest conversations
- Use notes to leave updates or @mention teammates
- Track mentions in a dedicated section

## Agents

### Teach Your AI

Your AI relies on the information it has to improve response quality. Teaching your AI ensures it has the most up-to-date and accurate details.

Knowledge can be applied to specific listings or globally.

  Configure your AI with the knowledge it needs to respond accurately.
</Card>

### Workflows

Workflows are custom automations you can build to scale your operations. They represent AI being able to do more than respond to messages but actually carry out tasks on your behalf.
