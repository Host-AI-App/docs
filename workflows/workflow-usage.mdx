## Overview

The platform empowers employees to become builders through flexible billing that ensures you only pay for what brings value to your business.

## How Credits Work

Credits measure computing power required by different actions. Each action or **node** consumes credits based on complexity and resource usage.

<Info>
  **Key Points:**
  - Lightweight actions (e.g., updating contact details) consume fewer or no credits
  - Advanced actions (e.g., AI messaging, VoiceAI) consume more credits
  - Only charged for credits actually used — no flat-rate increases
</Info>

## Credit Consumption

## What Happens if I Go Over My Credit Usage?

<Warning>
  When you approach your credit limit:
  - You will receive a notification when credits run low
  - You can upgrade to the next tier or pay for overages on your next invoice
</Warning>

## Why We're Making This Change

Flexible Billing allows Conduit to:

- Maintain existing base pricing for all users
- Enable power users to scale automation and VoiceAI affordably
- Offer transparent billing reflecting real usage and value
