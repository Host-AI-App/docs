## Overview

Agent Injection enables users to construct custom AI agents within workflows that function as team members in conversations, powered by Conduit's AI infrastructure.

<Note>
  **Key capability:** Works with both text and VoiceAI channels.
</Note>

### Use Cases

The node supports three primary scenarios:

- Guide users through multi-step processes
- Collect missing information from contacts
- Execute repeated follow-ups until objectives are achieved

Users maintain full control over agent tone, logic, and follow-through behaviors.

## Implementation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    Navigate to your workspace, create a trigger, then select **Add Action** > **Agent Injection** (or **Agent Injection Phone** for voice).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Identity">
    Assign a recognizable name (example: "Carl from Conduit") to establish agent personality.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Description">
    Define behavioral guidelines with a concise prompt such as: "You are Alex, a friendly customer support representative."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Role Selection">
    Choose one of two modes:
    - **Action**: Persuade users toward specific outcomes (booking confirmations, form uploads)
    - **Information**: Extract particular data points (delivery ETAs)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Configuration">
    - Write detailed instructions covering tone, constraints, and fallback protocols
    - Set follow-up frequency and intervals for retry attempts
  </Step>

  <Step title="First Message">
    Configure initial outreach by selecting:
    - Communication channel (Email, SMS, WhatsApp)
    - Sender identity
    - Subject line (email only)
    - Message body with optional dynamic variables (e.g., `{{guest.first_name}}`)

    Once deployed, the AI manages subsequent replies until task completion or follow-up limits are reached.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Important Note:** Agent Injection works across multiple inboxes with format-adaptive behavior adjustments.
