## Overview

You can build from scratch or use a template to speed things up. Each workflow runs step-by-step, executing the logic you define with dynamic inputs along the way.

## 1. Proactive Workflows

Outbound messages to customers running on preset schedules to provide information, review tasks, or upsell. These improve customer satisfaction and reduce manual work.

  <Card title="Examples">
    - Checking if a room is empty after checkout and offering a discount to extend their stay
    - Messaging checkout instructions to a guest the day before their checkout date
    - Reaching out to customers when an ordered item is no longer available and offering alternatives

## 2. Notification Workflows

Automatically alert your team or customers when specific conditions are met, ensuring the team stays informed and customers have a smooth experience.

  <Card title="Examples">
    - Responding to a guest with an SMS message when housekeeping has finished cleaning their room
    - Receiving an email when your AI Agent has scheduled a tour of your property
    - Sending a Slack message to your support team when a customer leaves negative feedback in a post-visit survey
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## 3. Triaging Workflows

Review a customer's question, and if the AI lacks an answer or needs human input, it automatically reaches out to your team for clarification. Once confirmed, it responds to the customer with the appropriate information.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Examples">
    - A guest asks about early check-in; the system contacts maintenance to verify room readiness before notifying the customer
    - A guest asks about pet policies; the AI agent pings the property manager to confirm current guidelines before replying
    - A customer asks about item restock availability; the AI reaches out to inventory or fulfillment team, then responds with expected restock date
