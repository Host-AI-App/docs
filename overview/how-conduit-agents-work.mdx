Conduit is an AI teammate system designed to be transparent, trainable, and fully controllable. The platform addresses a key limitation of typical AI tools by being the opposite of a "black box"—users can inspect reasoning, see sources, and make reliable updates to agent behavior.

## Four Core System Components

### 1. Inbox — The Mouth

- Unified conversation threads per contact across all channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp, voice, Airbnb, live-chat)
- AI responses are transparent, showing reasoning and sources
- Users can approve, edit, or teach the agent directly inline

### 2. Agent Hub — The Brain

- Teaching and fine-tuning environment
- Stores knowledge blocks (facts) and procedures (rules) in searchable format
- Flags missing information and conflicting facts
- Includes sandbox testing and test suites before deployment

### 3. Workflows — The Arms & Legs

Three workflow types automate communication:

- **Proactive workflows**: Scheduled or triggered outreach
- **Routing workflows**: Direct details to appropriate systems or team members
- **Triage workflows**: Escalate to humans when needed, then auto-close

### 4. Dashboards — The Nervous System

- Live metrics on automation rates, escalation reasons, and sentiment
- All charts connect to raw conversations for quick adjustments

## Deployment Model

The system launches with pre-built, industry-specific playbooks and intents. Most teams go live within a week and can customize brand voice, policies, enable/disable workflows, and write custom API functions.
