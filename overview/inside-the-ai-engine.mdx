description: "How Conduit's AI agents think through the Response Flow Pipeline - a five-stage reasoning system that powers AI-generated messages."
---

The Response Flow Pipeline is the reasoning core behind every AI-generated message in Conduit. It takes an incoming conversation, understands what's being asked, gathers the right information, uses the right tools, and either produces a safe, useful reply or routes the message for human follow-up when needed.

## Five-Stage Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Analysis">
    Understanding the request in context through:
    - **Message preparation**: Trimming conversation history
    - **Context building**: Creating an "analysis scratchpad"
    - **Classification**: Tagging by topic
    - **Action routing**: Deciding which tools/agents to run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Knowledge Search and Tool Execution">
    Gathering necessary information via:
    - **Hybrid search**: Across unstructured and structured sources
    - **Relevance filtering**: Removing duplicates
    - **Tool calls**: Executing external functions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Injection">
    Running specialized micro-agents for:
    - Extracting specific fields from conversations
    - Drafting follow-up questions when information is missing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reasoning Engine">
    Combining all context through:
    - Rules and guardrails analysis
    - Style guide application
    - Strategic planning
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reflection and Response Generation">
    Final validation including:
    - **Reflection checks**: Confidence assessment
    - **Response generation**: Writing the reply
    - **Post-processing**: Cleanup and signatures
  </Step>
</Steps>
