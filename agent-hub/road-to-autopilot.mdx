The **Agent Hub** functions as a control center for creating, refining, and deploying AI agents that manage communications. It integrates all necessary components to educate, validate, and ensure confidence in your AI system.

When accessing the Agents page, you'll see all your agents, with each corresponding to a distinct contact type. The system maintains a one-to-one mapping where every contact type has a dedicated agent. Each agent possesses:

- **Its own persona** - defining communication tone, style, and approach
- **Access to specific knowledge** - customized for that contact type
- **Its own set of tools** - enabling required actions for conversation categories

The Agent Hub mirrors the team onboarding process: initial close supervision with detailed guidance evolves into increased delegation as proficiency grows.

## From Copilot to Autopilot

This represents the progression from **Copilot** (AI creates draft replies for human approval) to **Autopilot** (AI transmits replies autonomously when confident).

### Four Connected Workflows

1. **Connect Sources & Tools** - Supply your AI with necessary facts and capabilities
2. **Teach** - Establish procedures, refine communication style, set boundaries
3. **Test** - Confirm modifications function as expected
4. **Deploy** - Activate automation with appropriate oversight levels

AI agents' effectiveness depends entirely on the knowledge, rules, and tools you supply—the Agent Hub provides comprehensive resources for ongoing agent improvement.
