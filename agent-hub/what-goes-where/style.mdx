# Style

Style defines how the AI communicates—tone, voice, formatting, and phrasing. It distinguishes between *what* the AI says (Knowledge), *when* it says it (Rules), and *how* it delivers messages. Style applies to every outgoing message across all topics, maintaining consistent brand voice.

## What Goes in Style?

- Preferred tone (e.g., warm, friendly, concise, professional)
- Specific phrasing conventions (e.g., first-person plural: "We'd love to help")
- Formatting rules (e.g., bullet points for step-by-step instructions)
- Emoji usage or restrictions
- Language preferences or regional variants (e.g., "flat" vs. "apartment")

## Where to Find Style

Navigate to: **Agent Hub > Agents > select an Agent > Populate your Style under Instructions**

From here, define how your AI should sound and maintain communication style when interacting with users. Changes apply only to the selected inbox. Clear Style definitions help the AI speak consistently and on-brand.

## Good Style Examples

- Use bullet points for multi-step instructions
- Write in warm, professional tone—avoid slang or overly casual language
- Use first-person plural: "we" instead of "I"
- Add celebratory emojis only for thank-you or celebration messages
- Limit message length to 3 short paragraphs maximum

These instructions are measurable, specific, and easy for the AI to follow consistently.

## What Not to Include

- Facts about stakeholder or contact - use **Knowledge**
- Conditional instructions - use **Rules**
- Prohibitions or safety restrictions - use **Guardrails**
