Procedures instruct the AI "how to answer the customer," not what internal actions to perform. Each procedure follows the pattern: "When a guest asks ... if ... then ..."

## Procedure Patterns

| Pattern | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Single If-Then (Binary Rule) | One condition, one response | Simple, clear-cut scenarios |
| Multi-Tree Rule | Several if branches beneath one trigger | Multiple possible conditions/outcomes |
| Workflow-Style Rule | Step-by-step guidance with checks in sequence | Troubleshooting or multi-step support flows |
| Templated Response Rule | Picks a ready-made reply template based on conditions | Fast, consistent messaging with variables |

### Key Points

1. Focus on the reply—describe what the AI should "say" or whether it should "escalate" to human staff
2. Stay conditional—use clear "if" clauses so the AI knows when to apply rules
3. Keep each rule self-contained—no need to reference other Procedures

## Where to Find Procedures

Navigate to: **Agent Hub > Wiki > Procedures**

Define conditions and instructions that guide AI responses based on message type, reservation details, or other triggers. All Procedures apply only to the selected inbox.

## Procedure Templates

Conduit offers preset templates for common procedures by industry. Users can fully customize templates in their workspace.

**To find Procedure templates:**
1. Navigate to Agent Hub > Knowledge > Wiki > Procedures > Add Procedure
2. Select "Import template" and choose from Conduit's predefined procedures

## Good vs Bad Procedures

### Example 1 - Condition Clarity

**Bad:** "If needed, let the guest check out late"—AI doesn't understand "needed"

**Good:** "If a guest requests late check-out and no new guest arrives same day, approve until 13:00"

### Example 2 - Guest-Focused Replies

**Bad:** "If guest reports damage, notify operations manager and create task"—AI cannot perform back-office actions

**Good:** "If guest reports damage, thank them and confirm team has been informed"

### Example 3 - Conditional Statements

**Bad:** "Offer 20% discount for repeat guests"—no context for when to use

**Good:** "If guest mentions prior stays, offer 20% discount on next booking"

### Example 4 - Knowledge vs Procedures

**Bad in Procedures:** "Pets are not allowed"—static policy, belongs in Knowledge

**Good:** "If guest brings dog and it's certified service animal, explain exception"

### Example 5 - Guardrails vs Procedures

**Vague:** "Do not disclose pricing differences"—permanent restriction

**Procedure:** "If guest asks why price differs elsewhere, explain platform variations"

**Guardrail:** "Never mention platform price differences in communications"

### Example 6 - Outcome Clarity

**Bad:** "If apartment is cold, fix heating"—no guest-facing instruction

**Good:** "If guest says too cold, ask if windows closed/thermostat above 21C, then alert team if unresolved"

### Example 7 - Verifiable Conditions

**Bad:** "If guest requests early check-in and cleaners are done, allow it"—AI can't verify real-time cleaning status

**Good:** "If guest requests early check-in, confirm you'll check with cleaning team and notify when ready"

## How the Reasoning Engine Uses Your Procedures

The processing steps are:

1. Engine reads all Procedures and matches "if" conditions against reservation data and chat context
2. Performs time/price calculations (e.g., "hours until arrival," "percentage refund")
3. Drafts reply following chosen policy, applies Style, and passes through Guardrails before sending

## FAQ

### What information can I refer to in Procedures?

Reference reservation details (dates, payment status, guest count), chat history, Knowledge base, and calendar availability. More data sources coming soon.

### When should I use templated replies?

Use carefully and only when exact wording is mandatory. These responses are sent verbatim, requiring very precise "if conditions" to prevent misuse.

**Key considerations:**
- Use only when specific wording is legally/policy-required
- Include detailed context for when template should/shouldn't be used
- Provide clear "if conditions" that must be met
- Consider adding fallback options

**Example well-defined templated rule:**
"If guest requests VAT invoice AND completed stay AND paid in full, use template: 'Thank you for requesting VAT invoice. I'll prepare within 24 hours. Please confirm company details: company name, address, VAT number.'"

### How do I test that the AI follows a Procedure?

Open Sandbox, adjust reservation details in Settings, impersonate the guest, send the triggering question, and verify the reply.
