Reaching autopilot depends on your AI's ability to respond to messages accurately and consistently. This requires a well-structured Knowledge Base where the AI retrieves relevant information through "Knowledge Blocks"—atomic units allowing quick retrieval of appropriate details at the right time.

## Types of Blocks

1. **Applies to One Listing:** Information tailored for single listings (e.g., Wi-Fi codes, check-in instructions)
2. **Applies to Multiple Listings:** Details for listing groups (e.g., neighborhood recommendations)
3. **Applies to All Listings:** Company-wide information (policies, standard procedures)

## Where to Find Knowledge

Navigate to: **Agent Hub > Wiki > Select an Agent**

Knowledge defined here applies only to selected inboxes; Global Knowledge applies to all inboxes.

## How to Write Knowledge

### Three Core Principles

1. **Directive:** Include only what the AI can say to guests—never internal instructions like "notify maintenance" or "send invoice"

2. **Comprehensive:** Each block fully covers its topic, including variations and follow-up questions; don't split related information across blocks

3. **Focused:** One block = one topic for clear AI retrieval and accurate responses

## Good vs. Bad Examples

### Wi-Fi Details

**Bad:**
Mixed unrelated topics, omits critical info, vague instructions

**Good:**
Clear title, network name in bold, password marked as case-sensitive, coverage area specified

### Pet Policy

**Bad:**
Minimal and vague, insufficient edge case detail

**Good:**
Covers policy, service animal exception, and non-compliance penalties

### Mixed Topics

**Bad:**
Combines separate workflows with unrelated requests

**Good:**
Focused solely on parking with specific location, price, and operational details

## Required Info

Filling out Required Info is critical for improving Autopilot rates, ensuring every company resource has essential details for accurate responses.

### Workflow

1. Upload external knowledge sources
2. Conduit automatically scrapes and populates Required Info fields marked as "Complete"
3. Fill remaining "Empty" fields manually to ensure full coverage

### Adding or Deleting Required Info Fields

**To Add Custom Fields:**
- Click "Add Field" in Required Info section
- Enter Field Name (e.g., "Refund Policy")
- Add Description guiding team on content
- Click "Create" to apply across all listings

**To Delete Fields:**
- Click on required info field
- Click "Field Settings" on modal
- Click "Delete"
