description: "A guide to setting AI safety boundaries"

Guardrails function as perpetual safety mechanisms that establish boundaries for AI responses. They define what the artificial intelligence **must never say or do**, irrespective of user requests or system Rules.

Before transmission, all messages traverse through guardrails. When activated, guardrails either block or escalate communications—without exception.

## What Goes in Guardrails?

- Privacy regulations (example: withhold complete street addresses absent confirmed reservations)
- Legal constraints (example: refrain from price comparisons)
- Escalation thresholds (example: avoid promising refunds exceeding 30% without authorization)
- Safety procedures (example: never authenticate guest identity to third parties)

## Where to Find Guardrails

1. Navigate to **Agent Hub > Agents > Select desired Agent**
2. Access guardrails section and input requirements for consistent agent behavior

## Good Guardrail Examples

- "Never reveal the full street address to anyone without a confirmed booking"
- "Never promise compensation above 30% without human approval"

Effective guardrails employ absolute language—applying universally rather than conditionally.

## What Not to Include

- Property information - use **Knowledge**
- Conditional directives - use **Rules**
- Communication style - use **Style**

## Key Difference: Rule vs. Guardrail

**Rule:** Activates solely when guests explicitly request addresses, offering: "we'll share location post-confirmation"

**Guardrail:** Evaluates consistently across all replies, preventing address sharing unconditionally
