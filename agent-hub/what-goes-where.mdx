Think of organizing AI assistant knowledge like making soup: Knowledge provides the essential ingredients, Rules are the recipe steps to follow, Style adds the flavor and spice, and Guardrails keep everything safely in the pot.

## Why We Separate the Layers

| Layer | What it stores | When the AI reads it | Why it helps |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Knowledge** | Factual details about stakeholders (customers, leads) or assets (properties, categories) | Only when needed to answer questions | Gives the AI facts to work with |
| **Rules** | If-then instructions for specific scenarios | When customer question matches rule condition | Automates SOPs and consistent replies |
| **Style** | How replies should sound (tone, formatting, voice) | Applied to every outgoing message | Keeps brand voice and clarity |
| **Guardrails** | Hard lines the AI can never cross | Checked before every single reply | Prevents risks (privacy, legal, promises) |
