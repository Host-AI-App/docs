# Conversation Tags

Conversation tags allow teams to categorize and prioritize guest messages, ensuring that important issues are identified and addressed quickly. Teams use tags for situations like "Early Check-In Requests," "Access Issues," "Broken Appliance," and "Refund Request."

By tagging these messages, teams can easily filter, organize, and prioritize conversations based on the nature of the guest message.

## Workflow

Tagged messages receive team notifications for critical guest concerns.

### Tagging Messages

- **Automatically Tagged Messages:** The AI tags messages automatically when relevant
- **Manually Tagged Messages:** Team members can apply tags directly in the conversation sidebar for immediate categorization

## Set Up

You can easily create, edit, and manage tags that are specific to the types of messages or problems you frequently encounter.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Go to Settings:** Navigate to Agent Hub > Agents > Select an Agent > Tags to view default tags including "Payment Issue," "Lease Inquiry," and "Access Issues"

2. **Create a New Tag:**
   - Click the "Add tag" button
   - Enter a short, descriptive Tag Name (example: "Maintenance Issue")
   - Provide a Tag Description explaining usage (example: "When a guest says something is broken")

3. **Set Escalation Levels:** Choose escalation levels where "Urgent" tags block AI responses during autopilot and escalate to human team members
