# Teach

The AI learns from two main inputs:

- The **sources** you connect
- The **teaching moments** you give it when it needs help or is missing information

## How to Teach

There are two teaching approaches:

1. **Synchronously from the inbox** - Direct conversation/escalation actions:
   - Add new knowledge
   - Edit existing knowledge
   - Create guardrails for tone, content, or process

2. **Asynchronously from the dashboard** - Review escalations in bulk, spot patterns, and fill knowledge gaps

## Key Activities

1. **Fill required info** - Ensure complete structured data and basic procedures
2. **Approve suggested knowledge** - AI proposes updates; user approval required before deployment
3. **Resolve knowledge conflicts** - Address inconsistencies between data sources
