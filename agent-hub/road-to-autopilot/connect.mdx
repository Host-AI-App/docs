## Overview

Before the AI can function effectively, it requires the proper **information** and **capabilities**. This foundation is essential for all subsequent steps in the automation process.

## Sources

Sources consolidate all necessary data for your AI in one location. The Agent Hub integrates with:

- **Property Management Systems (PMS):** Provides structured property and booking data with automatic syncing
- **External Integrations:** Supports Google Sheets, Notion, and similar platforms with scheduled or one-time imports
- **Files & Links:** Accepts PDFs, CSVs, hosted documents, and public web pages

### Connected AI Capabilities

- Instantly access current information
- Extract structured fields for **Required Info**
- Convert unstructured content into reusable knowledge blocks

### Import Process

1. Verify Integrations are connected to Conduit
2. Navigate to **Agent Hub > Import Sources > Import**
3. Select desired sources from URLs, third-party services, or uploaded files
4. Choose destination (specific Inbox Type or Global) and content type (Knowledge, Groups, or Listings)
5. Click **Import** and enable automatic syncing (optional)

## Tools

Tools enable the AI to execute actions—from booking creation to maintenance ticket logging.

- **Preset Tools:** Ready-to-use integrations and functions
- **Custom Tools:** Build tailored solutions matching your unique workflows

Each agent can have customized tool sets based on contact type and responsibilities, viewable in agent settings.
