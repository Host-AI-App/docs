After teaching your AI agent new knowledge, you need to confirm it applies that learning correctly through testing.

## Two Primary Testing Methods

### Regenerate Reply

For unsent proposed replies or cases with missing information, click the regenerate function to view updated responses.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Inbox** > Open a message
2. Locate a Proposed Reply > Click the circular arrow icon above the response

### Recreate in Sandbox

For messages already sent, use the "Recreate in Sandbox" button to simulate the same scenario with your updated AI system.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Inbox** > Open a message
2. Under **At a glance** section > Scroll to the **Recreate in Sandbox** icon
3. This navigates to Chat under Agent Hub, recreating recent messages. You can then act as the customer to test AI Agent responses.

## Test Suites

Run multiple scenarios simultaneously covering edge cases and recurring patterns, enabling batch simulations to verify reliable AI responses.
