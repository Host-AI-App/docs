Deployment is when you allow the AI to send replies on its own.

Users control both the **level** and **rules** for automation implementation.

## Automation Levels

The system offers three deployment modes:

1. **Off** - AI doesn't propose or send replies
2. **Copilot** - AI drafts, you approve or edit
3. **Autopilot** - AI sends confident replies automatically, escalates the rest

## Safety Controls

Implementation includes protective measures:

- **Delays** - Hold automatic sends for review
- **Working hours** - Restrict automation to certain times
- **Urgent tags** - Force certain types of messages to escalate, regardless of confidence

By repeating the Teach > Test > Deploy cycle, you can steadily expand what the AI handles, moving closer to full automation without losing oversight.
