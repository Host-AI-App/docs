## Internal Tools

Internal tools are available for both chat and voice agents and allow your Agent to manage availability, book appointments, and have access to the internet.

They are available automatically with your Conduit account, and have predetermined descriptions for when this tool can be called. Internal tool descriptions and waiting messages cannot be configured.

### Managing Access

To manage access:

1. Navigate to **Agent Hub > AI Tools > Select the tool > Access**
2. Individual agents can be enabled with the tool or enable Global access for all your chat and voice agents
