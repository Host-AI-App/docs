## Overview

The Slack integration enables users to manage guest communication within their existing Slack workspace. It streamlines communication and simplifies message approval, editing, and response processes.

## Connection Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Connect Slack account**
2. Select the Slack channel for receiving Conduit messages
3. Configure Settings and Notifications:
   - **Guest messages**: Receive alerts when guests send messages
   - **Upsells**: Get notifications about potential upsell opportunities
   - **Tasks**: Stay informed about task updates and deadlines

## Sending Messages from Slack

Guest messages funnel into the selected Slack account with options to Approve, Dismiss, or Edit Messages. Users can navigate to conversations in the Conduit inbox by clicking the "Go to Conversation" link.

## Clear the Slack Channel

To declutter a Conduit channel, use the keyboard shortcut `/clear_channel` to remove all messages.
