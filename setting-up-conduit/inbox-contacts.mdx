## Overview

Each inbox in Conduit centers around a specific contact type. By establishing dedicated inboxes, teams can tailor tools and workflows to match unique contact type requirements.

This organizational approach promotes:

- Efficient communication management
- Streamlined response workflows
- Controlled team member access to relevant conversations

### Adding Inboxes

To create additional inboxes:

1. Navigate to Settings > Inboxes
2. Select "+ Add Inbox" from the existing inboxes list
3. Complete setup by defining the contact type and default settings

## Inbox Settings

Customize each inbox to match specific contact type needs and configure relevant inbox settings.

## Navigating the Inbox

The Inbox acts as the mouth of the body, communicating with your customers and team. It ensures every conversation is responded to and every request is handled.

## Filter and Sort By

The right sidebar enables filtering responses by status, escalation level, and listing type. Adjacent sorting controls allow ascending or descending order organization.

**Message Status Categories:**

1. **Todo** - Pending messages requiring attention
2. **Follow up** - Messages for later response or handling
3. **Done** - Responded messages; moves back to Todo when contact replies

## Delete Inbox

Inboxes no longer in use can be removed from the General tab. Note: this action is irreversible.
