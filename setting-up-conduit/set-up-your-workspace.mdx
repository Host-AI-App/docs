## Overview

Conduit employs workspaces to organize team collaboration while keeping operations structured. These spaces enable separate accounts for different clients or departments while preserving real-time teamwork capabilities. For example, businesses managing multiple brands can maintain distinct workspaces without requiring separate accounts.

## General Setting

Setup involves three core actions:

1. **Create a Workspace** - Upon account creation, Conduit automatically generates an initial workspace serving as the central hub for company messaging and guest interactions.

2. **Add Members** - Navigate to Settings > Members > + Add, select the member's role, and proceed.

3. **Switch Between Workspaces** - Click the workspace name in the top left corner, hover over it, then select your desired workspace or create a new one.

## Managing Member Roles

Two primary roles exist:

- **Admin**: Full access to settings, user management, billing, and workspace configuration with authority to invite, promote, or demote members.
- **Member**: Limited access restricted to day-to-day functions like guest interaction and reservation management; cannot access billing or administrative features.

### Inviting Members

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Click the Add button
3. Enter the member's email address
4. Select Admin or Member role
5. Click Send Invite

New members receive an email with joining instructions. Members can switch between multiple workspaces via the app's navigation menu.

### Managing Current Members

In Settings > Members, administrators see active members and pending invites. The three-dot menu beside each name allows role editing or member removal.

## Member Invitations

Invited members receive email prompts to create accounts and join workspaces. Check spam folders if emails don't appear immediately. Administrators retain full flexibility to manage permissions and roles across multiple workspaces.
