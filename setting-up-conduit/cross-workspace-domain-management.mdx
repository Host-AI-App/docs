## Overview

In some cases, you may need to use the same domain across multiple workspaces within Conduit. This is common for organizations that manage multiple properties or brands under a single company domain but require separate workspaces for operational reasons.

## Adding a Domain to Another Workspace

### For Company Domain Users

If you have an email address that matches your company's domain (e.g., you@yourcompany.com), you can add that domain to additional workspaces even if it's already configured in another workspace.

To add an existing domain to a new workspace:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the workspace where you want to add the domain
2. Go to the email or domain configuration section
3. Follow the standard domain setup process
4. The system will recognize your company domain email and allow the domain to be added

<Note>
This feature is available for users whose email addresses match the company domain being added. The system verifies domain ownership through your authenticated email address.
</Note>

### For Non-Company Domain Users

If your email address does not match the domain you're trying to add (e.g., you're using a personal email or a different company email), the domain cannot be automatically added to another workspace through self-service.

In this case, please contact our support team to assist with adding the domain to your workspace:

- **Email**: support@conduit.ai
- **Subject**: Cross-Workspace Domain Addition Request

When contacting support, please provide:
- The domain you want to add
- The workspace name or ID where you want the domain added
- Your relationship to the domain (why you need access)

<Warning>
For security reasons, non-domain user requests require manual verification by our team to ensure proper authorization before adding domains across workspaces.
</Warning>

## Common Use Cases

- **Multi-property management**: Managing separate properties under the same brand, each with their own workspace
- **Regional operations**: Different regional teams using the same company domain but requiring separate workspaces
- **Department separation**: Keeping different departments isolated while sharing the same email domain
