- Integrate with Outlook, Gmail, and company email providers

## Requirements

**Allowed:**

- Multiple emails from the same domain
- Company domain-based addresses only

**Limitations:**

- One domain per workspace maximum
- Up to 10 emails per domain

## Setup Process

Two-step configuration required:

1. [Receiving Emails in Conduit](/setting-up-conduit/connect-email/receiving-emails-in-conduit)
2. [Sending Emails from Conduit](/setting-up-conduit/connect-email/sending-emails-from-conduit)

## Prerequisites
