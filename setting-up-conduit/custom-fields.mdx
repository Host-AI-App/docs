## Overview

Custom Fields enable users to add tailored attributes to contact types, facilitating better organization and display of relevant information in the inbox sidebar. Whether tracking homeowner deal statuses or identifying assigned support representatives, these fields streamline communication and provide essential context for conversations.

By defining attributes in Conduit, users can customize the sidebar layout, ensuring critical information remains prominently accessible.

## Setup

Setting up Custom Fields involves straightforward steps:

### Navigate to Custom Fields Settings

- Go to **Settings** > **Select an inbox** > **Custom Fields** from your sidebar
- Click **Create Attribute** to add a new custom field

### Create an Attribute

Available field types include:

- **Text** - for custom notes or URLs
- **Number** - for quantitative values like ratings
- **Checkbox** - for yes/no answers
- **Date** - for tracking specific dates or follow-ups
- **Phone Number** - for adding contact numbers
- **Member** - to assign workspace members
- **Select/Multi-Select** - for dropdown options

Provide the attribute a descriptive **Name** reflecting its purpose (e.g., "Deal Stage" or "Assigned Support Rep").

### Customize the Sidebar

Once attributes are created:

- Navigate to the **Customize Sidebar** section
- Drag and drop attributes to arrange them
- Add them to specific sections like **At a Glance** or **Details**
- Save changes to reflect updates in the inbox sidebar immediately

## Workflow

### Automatically Populate Fields

Many fields are automatically filled when syncing contacts from integrated channels like WhatsApp, Email, or Text.

### Manual Updates

Directly update fields from the contact's sidebar by clicking on the attribute and entering information (e.g., phone numbers, deal statuses).

### Use Cases for Custom Fields

- Track homeowner lead status with "Deal Stage" attribute
- Assign and display Customer Support Rep for conversation visibility
- Monitor key contact dates like "Last Contacted Date" for timely follow-ups
- Flag specific contacts with checkboxes for VIP customers or urgent inquiries

Custom Fields enable tailored Conduit experiences that ensure all relevant information remains readily accessible and current.
