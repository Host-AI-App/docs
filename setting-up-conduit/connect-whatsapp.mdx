## Overview

Conduit integrates with WhatsApp to manage all communications from your WhatsApp Business account directly within your Conduit inbox.

This integration streamlines communication by allowing you to respond to all messages, automate responses, and manage conversations in a unified platform. To use this feature, you must have a WhatsApp Business account.

Conduit offers two main options for integrating WhatsApp:

1. **Connect an Existing Business Account**: If your WhatsApp Business account already has registered phone numbers, Conduit will automatically sync and pull those numbers.

2. **Use a Conduit Number**: If your account does not have any registered numbers, you can generate a new WhatsApp business number through Conduit's Business Phone Number service.

Please refer to Meta's documentation for self-serve setup or fill out their form if you need Conduit's assistance.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Using Existing Number**: A verification code will be sent via WhatsApp to the registered number. Enter this code in Conduit to complete setup.
