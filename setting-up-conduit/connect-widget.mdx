## Overview

Widgets allow Conduit to communicate with visitors on your website in real-time, with all messages flowing directly into the Conduit inbox.

This customizable chat interface can be embedded on any webpage to provide immediate support, answer inquiries, and capture leads without leaving the Conduit platform.

## Workflow

When site visitors engage with the widget, conversations are routed directly to your inbox's connected channels section. The system supports:

- **Real-Time Conversations**: Direct interaction between visitors and support team members
- **Automated Messaging**: Set up greetings or responses for initial inquiries and after-hours situations
- **Inbox Integration**: Widget conversations seamlessly integrate with Conduit's inbox, allowing agents to respond like any other guest inquiry
- **Conversation History**: Once the chat ends, the conversation remains in your Conduit inbox for future reference and follow-up

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Widget Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Widget** in Conduit to:

- Customize the header and greeting message
- Set the assistant name
- Modify post-form messaging (e.g., "We'll get back to you as soon as possible!")

### 2. Add the Widget to Your Website

- Copy the code snippet from Widget Settings
- Paste it into the `<head>` tag of your webpage

### 3. Add Trusted Domains (Optional)

Restrict widget appearance by listing your company's domains in the Trusted Domains section.

Once deployed, the widget goes live on your website, providing visitors direct access to your support team.
