## Overview

Conduit enables teams to manage multiple company email addresses within a single inbox. This feature facilitates handling various inquiry types while maintaining unified support workflows.

Teams can reply using the appropriate alternate address, and the system defaults to matching the customer's original contact email.

## Setup Instructions

**Configuration limit:** Up to 10 alternate email addresses per workspace

**Location:** Settings > Email page

### Requirements

Alternate email addresses must satisfy two conditions:

1. **Domain matching:** Must share the same domain as the primary support email
   - Example: If primary is help@avantstays.com, you may add hello@avantstays.com but not sales@tnt.com

2. **Email forwarding:** Must be forwarded identically to your main help email address, using Conduit's provided forwarding destination

## Functionality

Once configured, team members can select which alternate address to use when composing responses. The system intelligently defaults to replying from the address the customer originally contacted.
