## Overview

The system allows you to forward emails from company addresses (like bookings@avantstays.com) to your Conduit inbound address, centralizing conversations for easier tracking and response management. It works with Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and other email providers.

## Setup Requirements

You need an inbound email address ending in "@inbound.postmark.app" found under **Settings > Email** in your workspace.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Navigate to Settings > Connected Channels > Email
2. Add your business domain email
3. Go to Gmail routing configuration
4. Add a new rule under Default routing
5. Select "Single recipient" and enter your support email
6. Check "Change envelope recipient"
7. Choose either "Replace recipient" or "Also deliver to"
8. Set members the rule applies to
9. Click Save

## Important Notes

- The guide assumes Google Workspace usage but provides alternatives (DNSimple, Microsoft 365)
- Two delivery options: "Replace recipient" (Conduit only) vs. "Also deliver to" (multiple destinations)
- Existing routing rules may conflict; reorder Conduit rules to apply first
