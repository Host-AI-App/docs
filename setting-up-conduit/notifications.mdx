## Overview

Notifications in Conduit allow you to stay updated on important events and messages without needing to monitor the platform constantly.

The system enables email-based alerts tailored to user priorities, ensuring critical updates aren't missed while allowing customization of what triggers notifications.

## Setup Instructions

To configure notifications, users should:

1. Access **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Enable the notification feature
3. Select which activities trigger alerts (connected channel activity, specific inbox messages, billing updates)

## Spam Management

The platform includes functionality for managing unwanted messages through spam rules.

**Process for adding spam rules:**

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Spam** > **Add Spam Rule**
2. Enter the contact's email or phone number
3. Optionally add contact name or email conditions
4. Select **Create Rule**

<Warning>
If the sender you want to mark as spam is linked to an existing contact in Conduit, you'll need to delete that contact first.
</Warning>
